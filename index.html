Hepatitis infection is a major public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income nations. One of the most vulnerable groups is pregnant women, who are more likely to contract the hepatitis virus (HCV). Comprehensive studies on hepatitis virus infection in pregnant women in low-income nations are, however, lacking. Earlier research concentrated more on the general public than on expectant mothers. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of hepatitis virus infection and investigate risk factors among pregnant patients at Lagos State's Shogunle Primary Health Care Center in Nigeria.  A cross-sectional method was employed in this epidemiological study to gather data from pregnant women who were getting antenatal care services at the health facility. Fast diagnostic tests for the hepatitis virus and structured interviews were used in the data collection process. To determine the risk factors and estimate the prevalence of the hepatitis virus, descriptive and inferential statistical studies were performed.
According to preliminary data, pregnant patients at Lagos State's Shogunle Primary Health Care Center had a notable prevalence of hepatitis virus infection. Maternal age, the mother's financial situation, and her history of blood transfusions have all been identified as possible risk factors for hepatitis virus infection during pregnancy. Additional research is being undertaken to examine other factors associated with hepatitis virus infection and evaluate the consequences for mothers and newborns. The results of this study have a big impact on public health practices and policy in Nigeria and other low-income nations. To lower the incidence of hepatitis virus infection among pregnant women and enhance mother and child health outcomes in these environments, interventions targeted at avoiding forward spread of the virus and enhancing access to antenatal care services are desperately needed.    </textarea
